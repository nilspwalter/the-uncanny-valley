# The Uncanny Valley: Exploring Adversarial Robustness from a Flatness Perspective

We use code from several resources, which we disclose here. First, the basis for training and 
attacking the CNNs stems from [Sehwag et al., 2020]. We modified the code according to our needs. The
code for DenseNet121 stems from the official PyTorch library. To attack and evaluate the LLMs
we use the official implementation of the attack [Zou et al., 2023]. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 were
also downloaded from PyTorch. The LLMs stem from HuggingFace.
